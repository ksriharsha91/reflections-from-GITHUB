The DIFF command didnt really help me perfectly find the difference. It was a bit tedious since the colouring was black and white. 

it makes me an efficient programmer by connecting all my ideas thrugh my history. 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
VC systems save codes and usually codes are written in a bunch of folders. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log gives us a comprehensive list of commits made with the help of following info. git commit ids, author name , date and time and message of the commit. 

git diff makes us compare two different versions of the commits so at two different time instances. We have to compare two files with their IDS.
